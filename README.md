## Overview

I would like to thank you for the good communication and also for this wonderful task that contains new ideas and also requires many research sources. I will certainly work on it again in order to delve deeper and also have some ideas for writing new articles.

During the four tasks, if I were to count each task from 25 degree, the results would be as follows

- Twitter Task 0/25.
- Frontend Task 20/25.
- Hierarchical Task 25/25.
- Queries Task  25/25.
So Total will be 70/100

Note : There will be a folder containing pictures of the results and problems and a copy of DataBase and Api collection.
## Let's take about every task

### Twitter
I think this will be the subject of my next article 
- I made app in Twitter Developer
- I used a populer package to deal with the external API to retrieve tweets and store it, despite many attempts, until that attempt failed , Here there was a point that was not clear to me in setting up the Twitter application and dealing with the package correctly.
- Using MongoDB It is supposed to be quite easy for me, and I know how to use it and connect it to the Larvel application, but I faced a problem. I uploaded a picture of it. I tried to solve it in various ways, but I did not succeed 

### Frontend 
- I created the Firebase app
- You choose Register and then enter data such as name, phone number, and password
- You will receive an otp to your phone number and you will be directed to the code confirmation page
- Here I encountered a problem that I cannot grasp the code that is being sent to compare it with the code that the user will enter. I created a fixed code in order to complete the process.
- otp code 123456
- for upload image after login for dashboard you find it and try it
- 
### Hierarchical & Queries
- There are pictures of the results for these two tasks, and also try the collection
